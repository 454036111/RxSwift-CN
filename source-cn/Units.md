## Why

Swift has a powerful type system that can be used to improve correctness and stability of applications and make using Rx a more intuitive and straightforward experience.
Swift 拥有一个强大的类型系统，这能用来提高正确性和应用的稳定性，并且使使用 Rx 成为更直观和直接的经历。

**Units are specific only to the [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa) project. However, the same principles could easily be implemented in other Rx implementations, if necessary. There is no private API magic needed.**
**Units 仅在 [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa) 项目中。然而如果有需要，同样的原理可以很轻松的被实现在其他 Rx 的实现中。这里没有私有API的魔法需要**

**Units are totally optional. You can use raw observable sequences everywhere in your program and all RxCocoa APIs work with observable sequences.**
**Units 是完全可选的。你可以在你程序的任何地方使用原始的 observable 序列，并且所有 RxCocoa 的接口能和 observable 序列兼容使用**

Units also help communicate and ensure observable sequence properties across interface boundaries.
Units 还帮助交流和确认 observable 序列属性穿越接口边界。

Here are some of the properties that are important when writing Cocoa/UIKit applications.
当我们在写 Cocoa/UIKit 时，这有一些重要的属性。

* Can't error out
* Observe on main scheduler
* Subscribe on main scheduler
* Sharing side effects
* 不能错误退出
* 在主调度器上观察
* 在主调度器上订阅
* 分享副作用

## How they work

At its core, it's just a struct with a reference to observable sequence.
在它的核心中，它只是一个引用 observable 序列的结构。

You can think of them as a kind of builder pattern for observable sequences. When a sequence is built, calling `.asObservable()` will transform a unit into a vanilla observable sequence.
你可以把他们想成一种 observable 序列的构造模型。当一个序列被构造，调用 `.asObservable()` 将转换一个 unit 成为一个 observable 序列。

## Why they are named Units

Using a couple analogies will help us reason about unfamiliar concepts. Here are some analogies showing how units in physics and RxCocoa (Rx units) are similar.
使用一对类比将会帮助我们解释不常见的理念。下面是一些类比告诉我们 units 在物理世界和 RxCocoa（Rx units）之间的相似点。

Analogies:

| Physical units                      | Rx units                                                            |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| number (one value)                  | observable sequence (sequence of values)                            |

Physical units and [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis#Checking_equations_that_involve_dimensions) can alleviate certain classes of errors during complex calculations.<br/>
Type checking Rx units can alleviate certain classes of logic errors when writing reactive programs.
物理单位和 [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis#Checking_equations_that_involve_dimensions) 可以在复杂计算中减缓一些错误级别。

Numbers have operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.<br/>
Observable sequences also have operators: `map`, `filter`, `flatMap` ...
数字有一些操作符: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.<br/>
Observable 序列也有一些操作符: `map`, `filter`, `flatMap` ...

Physics units define operations by using corresponding number operations. E.g.
物理单位通过使用相应的数字操作定义操作符，比如：

`/` operation on physical units is defined using `/` operation on numbers.
`/` 操作在物理单位被定义为使用 `/` 操作数字。

11 m / 0.5 s = ...
* First, convert the unit to **numbers** and **apply** `/` **operator** `11 / 0.5 = 22`
* Then, calculate the unit (m / s)
* Lastly, combine the result = 22 m / s

Rx units define operations by using corresponding observable sequence operations (this is how operators work internally). E.g.

The `map` operation on `Driver` is defined using the `map` operation on its observable sequence.

```swift
let d: Driver<Int> = Drive.just(11)
driver.map { $0 / 0.5 } = ...
```

* First, convert `Driver` to **observable sequence** and **apply** `map` **operator**
```swift
let mapped = driver.asObservable().map { $0 / 0.5 } // this `map` is defined on observable sequence
```

* Then, combine that to get the unit value
```swift
let result = Driver(mapped)
```

There is a set of basic units in physics [(`m`, `kg`, `s`, `A`, `K`, `cd`, `mol`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit) that is orthogonal.<br/>
There is a set of basic interesting properties for observable sequences in `RxCocoa` that is orthogonal.

    * Can't error out
    * Observe on main scheduler
    * Subscribe on main scheduler
    * Sharing side effects

Derived units in physics sometimes have special names.<br/>
E.g.
```
N (Newton) = kg * m / s / s
C (Coulomb) = A * s
T (Tesla) = kg / A / s / s
```

Rx derived units also have special names.<br/>
E.g.
```
Driver = (can't error out) * (observe on main scheduler) * (sharing side effects)
ControlProperty = (sharing side effects) * (subscribe on main scheduler)
Variable = (can't error out) * (sharing side effects)
```

Conversion between different units in physics is done with the help of operators defined on numbers `*`, `/`.<br/>
Conversion between different Rx units in done with the help of observable sequence operators.

E.g.

```
Can't error out = catchError
Observe on main scheduler = observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
Subscribe on main scheduler = subscribeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
Sharing side effects = share* (one of the `share` operators)
```


## RxCocoa units

### Driver unit

* Can't error out
* Observe on main scheduler
* Sharing side effects (`shareReplayLatestWhileConnected`)

### ControlProperty / ControlEvent

* Can't error out
* Subscribe on main scheduler
* Observe on main scheduler
* Sharing side effects

### Variable

* Can't error out
* Sharing side effects

## Driver

This is the most elaborate unit. Its intention is to provide an intuitive way to write reactive code in the UI layer.

### Why it's named Driver

Its intended use case was to model sequences that drive your application.

E.g.
* Drive UI from CoreData model
* Drive UI using values from other UI elements (bindings)
...


Like normal operating system drivers, in case a sequence errors out, your application will stop responding to user input.

It is also extremely important that those elements are observed on the main thread because UI elements and application logic are usually not thread safe.

Also, `Driver` unit builds an observable sequence that shares side effects.

E.g.


### Practical usage example

This is a typical beginner example.

```swift
let results = query.rx_text
    .throttle(0.3, scheduler: MainScheduler.instance)
    .flatMapLatest { query in
        fetchAutoCompleteItems(query)
    }

results
    .map { "\($0.count)" }
    .bindTo(resultCount.rx_text)
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)

results
    .bindTo(resultsTableView.rx_itemsWithCellIdentifier("Cell")) { (_, result, cell) in
        cell.textLabel?.text = "\(result)"
    }
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)
```

The intended behavior of this code was to:
* Throttle user input
* Contact server and fetch a list of user results (once per query)
* Bind the results to two UI elements: results table view and a label that displays the number of results

So, what are the problems with this code?:
* If the `fetchAutoCompleteItems` observable sequence errors out (connection failed or parsing error), this error would unbind everything and the UI wouldn't respond any more to new queries.
* If `fetchAutoCompleteItems` returns results on some background thread, results would be bound to UI elements from a background thread which could cause non-deterministic crashes.
* Results are bound to two UI elements, which means that for each user query, two HTTP requests would be made, one for each UI element, which is not the intended behavior.

A more appropriate version of the code would look like this:

```swift
let results = query.rx_text
    .throttle(0.3, scheduler: MainScheduler.instance)
    .flatMapLatest { query in
        fetchAutoCompleteItems(query)
            .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)  // results are returned on MainScheduler
            .catchErrorJustReturn([])           // in the worst case, errors are handled
    }
    .shareReplay(1)                             // HTTP requests are shared and results replayed
                                                // to all UI elements

results
    .map { "\($0.count)" }
    .bindTo(resultCount.rx_text)
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)

results
    .bindTo(resultTableView.rx_itemsWithCellIdentifier("Cell")) { (_, result, cell) in
        cell.textLabel?.text = "\(result)"
    }
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)
```

Making sure all of these requirements are properly handled in large systems can be challenging, but there is a simpler way of using the compiler and units to prove these requirements are met.

The following code looks almost the same:

```swift
let results = query.rx_text.asDriver()        // This converts a normal sequence into a `Driver` sequence.
    .throttle(0.3, scheduler: MainScheduler.instance)
    .flatMapLatest { query in
        fetchAutoCompleteItems(query)
            .asDriver(onErrorJustReturn: [])  // Builder just needs info about what to return in case of error.
    }

results
    .map { "\($0.count)" }
    .drive(resultCount.rx_text)               // If there is a `drive` method available instead of `bindTo`,
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)              // that means that the compiler has proven that all properties
                                              // are satisfied.
results
    .drive(resultTableView.rx_itemsWithCellIdentifier("Cell")) { (_, result, cell) in
        cell.textLabel?.text = "\(result)"
    }
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)
```

So what is happening here?

This first `asDriver` method converts the `ControlProperty` unit to a `Driver` unit.

```swift
query.rx_text.asDriver()
```

Notice that there wasn't anything special that needed to be done. `Driver` has all of the properties of the `ControlProperty` unit, plus some more. The underlying observable sequence is just wrapped as a `Driver` unit, and that's it.

The second change is:

```swift
.asDriver(onErrorJustReturn: [])
```

Any observable sequence can be converted to `Driver` unit, as long as it satisfies 3 properties:
* Can't error out
* Observe on main scheduler
* Sharing side effects (`shareReplayLatestWhileConnected`)

So how do you make sure those properties are satisfied? Just use normal Rx operators. `asDriver(onErrorJustReturn: [])` is equivalent to following code.

```
let safeSequence = xs
  .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)       // observe events on main scheduler
  .catchErrorJustReturn(onErrorJustReturn) // can't error out
  .shareReplayLatestWhileConnected         // side effects sharing
return Driver(raw: safeSequence)           // wrap it up
```

The final piece is using `drive` instead of using `bindTo`.

`drive` is defined only on the `Driver` unit. This means that if you see `drive` somewhere in code, that observable sequence can never error out and it observes on the main thread, which is safe for binding to a UI element.

Note however that, theoretically, someone could still define a `drive` method to work on `ObservableType` or some other interface, so to be extra safe, creating a temporary definition with `let results: Driver<[Results]> = ...` before binding to UI elements would be necessary for complete proof. However, we'll leave it up to the reader to decide whether this is a realistic scenario or not.
